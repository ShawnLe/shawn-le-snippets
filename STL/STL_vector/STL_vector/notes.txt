- cannot read *.dll automatically, files need to be copied

- considering if the schedule can be met or not (crash again?!)


pthread or boost?? 

- hcm uses pthread in Linux

=> boost or openMP/TBB ??

=> OpenMP/TBB is more read-to-use solution (library and code support). so 
choose TBB

- install TBB & test it, if finish soon, do next-day work:
=> GNU make utility 
=> too complicated => do when having free time

- workspace filter:
+ 250, 250 => 1000, 900: obstacles or goals out of this range will not be
counted
=> skip this one, search for more generic module: find union contour of
contours

=> next task: modularize P3DX controller

=> i've already achieved the mood after 4 months in NTUST, now just keep 
the balance, maintain it and I will have everything I want
=> playing with the thinkings in my head

18/1/12

=> finished modulization of controller

next with P3DX: 
- find union contour of contours -> fun
- scale up/enlarge contour -> fun
- a point in contour -> fun
- close loop controller -> application
- multiple source code program -> no book

** Corke:
- p457 & p261
=> next day: more time to work

- p466: vservo method
continue with IBVS Corke in more detail

20/1/12
- p462 -> continue to read image Jacob in deeper (hard to understand &
to use)

- visp tracking methods: 4 methods
+ point
+ edge -> edge detector -> line, elipse, nurp
+ KLT Kanade-Lucas-Tomashi
+ 3D model
+ implemented using classes (OOP)
+ depth prob: 
	. avoid unknown depth prob
	. point tracking: freeman chain, size, moment
+ ctrl func: minimizing image feature objective func
+ generic feature

22/01/12
=> read VISP papers:
- create interaction matrix which combines a set of visual features
?? how to combine discrete features to create task feature
?? IBVS control perspective of VISP

- Doctor Degree future:
+ graduated earns 55.200USD/yr, just 5% higher than a Master Deg holder (in Canada 2009)

24/01/12

28/01/12

- RAS new issue:
+ review KUKA toolbox later => go deeper for application
+ review turning point PIC => robotics research career 
=> revise "direction for doctorate deg" from the news just read

30/01/12

- Research career:
+ Portugal: Institute of Systems and Robotics (ISR), Portugese Society of Robotics (SPR)
Univ. of Coimbra, Aveiro, Porto, Lisbon
+ France: VISP
+ Netherland: 
+ Germany:

- install VISP: 
=> not installed yet sec.3, step 7 => install now or will go back to this later OR
no need to install ?!
=> build helloworld OK, but cannot find visp-2.dll -> recompile/rebuild VISP OR
not include enuf lib (generated by bat executable)?! -> stuck at libpath (bat file)

01/02/12


- install VISP: 
=> not installed yet sec.3, step 7 => installed => errors (no visp-2.dll):
+ source download is OK 
+ source folder is OK
+ step 7 UNDERSTOOD
+ cross-check building process is OK => remember "Release" mode (new!)
=> Cmake built was not correct => rebuild is OK now => check Helloworld again

1st time (v1.0 build):
=> build helloworld OK, but cannot find visp-2.dll -> recompile/rebuild VISP OR
not include enuf lib (generated by bat executable)?! -> stuck at libpath (bat file)

2nd time (v2.0 build):
- cannot build Helloworld => find & build other proj??
=> build & run helloworld is OK now!! => lack of additional dependencies (libraries)

- VISP demos:
+ cannot run the "example" folder -> how to use them?
+ wireframe simulation -> try later
=> solution: + read the downloaded docs + lagadic homepage/Overview:...


- P3DX:
- workspace filter:
+ 250, 250 => 1000, 900: 
++ goals out of this range will not be counted => done => works effectively
++ obstacles out of this range will not be counted

- contour scaling

02/02/12

- VISP demos:
+ cannot run the "example" folder -> how to use them?
+ wireframe simulation -> try later
=> solution: + read the downloaded docs + lagadic homepage/Overview:...

- VISP doc preview: 
+ image manipulation has good examples
+ computer vision has few/only 1 example 
+ docs tend to be theoretical
+ all docs provide few app demos, not enuf for real apps => possibility to build complex apps by 
ownself
+ visual servoing tasks: 2 last examples are improtant
+ Sure that VISP can be used & applied?? or its docs are too few, tutorials/demos are also few?!
+ there are examples and additioal dependecies in header files & many explanations
+ VISP additional installations: ** visp heavily depends on third-party libs -> very complex installation
++ camera: 
++ display: corresponding third party libs

- P3DX: polygon expansion - see all from a post of stackoverflow
+ term: inward/outward polygon offseting, polygon buffering, 
+ polygon clipping and offsetting library - Clipper -> written by Angus Johnson
+ CGAL library 
+ GIS library 
+ JTS library
=> choose Angus Johnson - Clipper library

- Corke:
+ many demos do not run properly
++ search emails for corrections
++ skip and check with TPE MATLAB installation
++ skip and continue with visual servoing theory

- Review & task planning:
** next week tasks:
* from last week:
- visp
- P3DX
- Corke Simulation & Theory
* new tasks:
- thread programming
- pose estimation
- interaction matrix
=> where time for skill development/implementation? 
=> avoid repeating old tasks
